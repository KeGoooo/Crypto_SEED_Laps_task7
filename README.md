# Crypto_SEED_Laps_task7
The task tells me to find the key of encrypted text and he gave me some hints.

I know the text was encrypted by AES-128-CBC.

I know what the text was before the encrypting, and it is: "This is a top secret.".

And the iv was "aabbccddeeff00998877665544332211".

Also the text after the encrypting which it is: "764aa26b55a4da654df6b19e4bce00f4ed05e09346fb0e762583cb7da2ac93a2"
